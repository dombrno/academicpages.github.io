I am a physicist, specializing in condensed matter theory of systems involving strongly correlated electrons. In particular, I have worked on high-temperature superconductors as well as excitonic condensation. I received my Ph.D. from [Masaryk University Brno](http://www.physics.muni.cz/ufkl/index.en.shtml), and my M.Sc. from [Ecole Normale Superieure](http://www.ens.fr/en).
